# üç≤ Red Soup

*Reddit: Scoop Out User Posts!*

Red Soup is a comment scraper that plucks out keywords from comments in selected subreddits. Right now the functionality is minimal, but pulls what it's asked to pull. Users can customize their choices in the settings file.

## üç≤ Guide

### Installing

At the moment, Red Soup requires you to have NodeJS and npm. Clone the repo, run `npm install`, and then start the program with default settings by running `npm start`. You can change the variables in `settings.js` to suit your needs.

### Examples

*Note: `/\w+/i` is a [regular expression](https://regexr.com/) search; the `i` indicates case-insensitive searching.*

###### Find the word "adorable" in comments from r/aww, r/blep, and r/sploot.

```JS
  custom: {
    'subs': 'aww+blep+sploot',
    'regEx': /adorable/i
  }
```

###### Find the words "sorry, but" in r/all.

```JS
  custom: {
    'subs': 'all',
    'regEx': /(sorry(,?) but/i
  }
```
